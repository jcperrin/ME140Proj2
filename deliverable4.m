%% Deliverable 4
% Using your stagnation temperature data, find the power consumed by the
% compressor and produced by the turbine and plot these on the same graph
% vs. spool speed. 

%%
% Use these data to find the adiabatic efficiencies of
% these components.

%%
% Find the stagnation pressure ratio across the combustor (essentially that
% across the liner since the pressure drop along the axis of the combustor
% is very small) and the adiabatic efficiency of the nozzle.

%%
% Since we are modeling combustion as though it were heat transfer to air,
% it is also possible to define an ?apparent combustion efficiency? as the
% change in enthalpy of the air (as determined from T measurements) per
% unit heating value of the fuel used. Calculate this value from your data.

%%
% Plot each of these quantities as a function of engine speed.
