%% Usefull Constants
% These are mostly conversion factors so that we can convert from imperial
% units collected into metric.

insqToMsq = 0.00064516; % [m^2/in^2]
lbfToN = 4.44822; % [N/lbf]

%% Given Data
% The following values were supplied to us in the original project
% specifications and should not be changed.

pitotEffectiveArea = 6.4*insqToMsq; % [m^2]
jetAHeating = 42.8e6; % [J/kg/K]
A = [27.3, 6.4, 9.0, 7.2, 4.7, 3.87]'.*insqToMsq; % [m^2]

%% Import Collected Data
% Our collected data is in an excel file named `Data_proj2`. Here we import
% that data into a vector for use in our MatLab script. The excel file
% should never be modified by our script.

fname = 'Data_proj2.xlsx';
sname = 'CollectedData';
range = 'A2:M10';
[NUM, TXT, RAW] = xlsread(fname, sname, range); % more basic reading
% option
% collectedData = readtable(fname, 'Sheet', sname, 'Range', range);
