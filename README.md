## Deliverables
1. Tables
	* Table of data from lab (temperature, pressure, fuel flow, thrust).
	* Table of relevant flow areas
2. Plots (four) of the following quantities vs. spool speed
	* Station (1-5,8) stagnation pressure 
	* Station (1-5,8) stagnation temperature 
	* Station (1-5,8) Mach number
	* Station (1-5,8) velocity
3. Plot of air flow rate, fuel flow rate, and air-fuel ratio vs. spool speed
4. Plot of measured thrust and calculated thrust vs. spool speed
5. Plot of specific thrust and thrust specific fuel consumption vs spool speed
6. Plot of thermal efficiency vs spool speed
7. Plot of compressor power and turbine power vs spool speed
8. Plot of compressor, turbine, and nozzle adiabatic efficiencies, combustor stagnation pressure loss, and “apparent combustion efficiency” vs spool speed
