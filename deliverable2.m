%% Deliverable 2
% Use your performance data and area measurements (listed in Appendix) to
% construct a series of plots showing how the following quantities vary
% with spool speed: 
%
% * station stagnation temperature (K), 
% * station stagnation pressure (kPa, absolute), 
% * station Mach number
% * station velocity (m/s). 
%
% Make sure to include Station 1 in all of your plots.

%% 
% Plot the mass flow rates of air and fuel (g/s) and the air-fuel ratio vs.
% spool speed.

%%
% Use your data to calculate the net thrust force and plot this along with
% the measured thrust (from the strain gage) vs. spool speed. Use air with
% variable specific heats as the working fluid. (Next week you will add
% products of combustion to your analysis and thereby be able to see the
% affect on your results.)
